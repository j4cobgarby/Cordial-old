## What needs doing?
  - [ ] A database for all the cards. (I'll be doing this one, but help is appreciated!)
  - [ ] Support for image uploading.
  - [x] Mobile support.
  - [ ] User accounts
  - [x] Instead of choosing colour, choose topic - colour will be based on this.
  - [ ] Making a modal, dropdown or something like that appear for the message entry.
